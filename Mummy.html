<p>The Chinchorro mummies are mummified remains of individuals from the South American Chinchorro culture, found in what is now northern Chile. They are the oldest examples of artificially mummified human remains, having been buried up to two thousand years before the Egyptian mummies. The earliest mummy that has been found in Egypt dated around 3000 BCE, the oldest anthropogenically modified Chinchorro mummy dates from around 5050 BCE.

The oldest naturally mummified corpse recovered from the Atacama Desert is dated around 7020 BCE.

Shell midden and bone chemistry suggest that 90% of the people's diet was seafood. Many ancient cultures of fisherfolk existed, tucked away in the arid river valleys of the Andes, but the Chinchorro made themselves unique by their dedicated preservation of the dead.

The Chinchorro culture settlements and artificial mummification process in Arica and Parinacota were declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2021.</p></body><br>

Archaeologists in Peru have said a mummy unearthed on the outskirts of the capital Lima could be between 800 and 1,200 years old. The mummy was found in a burial chamber about three metres (10 feet) long and 1.4 metres (4.5 feet) deep in Cajamarquilla, which is about 24km (14.9 miles) east of Lima.It appears to be the remains of a man who was aged about 18 to 22 years old when he died. The body was discovered bound with a rope, with the hands covering the face.

Scientists would use carbon dating to determine the exact age of the mummy.

Van Dalen said Cajamarquilla was an urban centre that could have been home to 10,000-20,000 people. It was built in approximately 200 BC and was occupied until about 1500 AD.

Also found inside the tomb was the skeleton of an Andean guinea pig and what archaeologists believe to be a dog. Traces of corn and other vegetables were found in the burial chamber. The discovery was first made public on Friday.</p></body>
